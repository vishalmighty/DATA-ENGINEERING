#### **1⃣ SQL Question 1: Identify VIP Users for Netflix**

**Question**: To better cater to its most dedicated users, Netflix would like to identify its “VIP users” - those who are most active in terms of the number of hours of content they watch. Write a SQL query that will retrieve the top 10 users with the most watched hours in the last month.

**Tables**:
- **users** table: `user_id` (integer), `sign_up_date` (date), `subscription_type` (text)
- **watching_activity** table: `activity_id` (integer), `user_id` (integer), `date_time` (timestamp), `show_id` (integer), `hours_watched` (float)

**Answer**:
```sql
WITH last_month_data AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        SUM(hours_watched) AS total_hours
    FROM
        watching_activity
    WHERE
        date_time >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL -1 MONTH)
    GROUP BY
        user_id
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    total_hours
FROM
    last_month_data
ORDER BY
    total_hours DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **2⃣ SQL Question 2: Analyzing Ratings For Netflix Shows**

**Question**: Given a table of user ratings for Netflix shows, calculate the average rating for each show within a given month. Assume that there is a column for `user_id`, `show_id`, `rating` (out of 5 stars), and `date` of review. Order the results by month and then by average rating (descending order).

**Tables**:
- **show_reviews** table: `review_id` (integer), `user_id` (integer), `review_date` (timestamp), `show_id` (integer), `stars` (integer)

**Answer**:
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(review_date, '%Y-%m') AS review_month,
    show_id,
    AVG(stars) AS avg_rating
FROM
    show_reviews
GROUP BY
    review_month, show_id
ORDER BY
    review_month, avg_rating DESC;
```

#### **3⃣ SQL Question 3: What does EXCEPT / MINUS SQL commands do?**

**Question**: Explain the purpose and usage of the EXCEPT (or MINUS in some SQL dialects) SQL commands.

**Answer**:
The `EXCEPT` (or `MINUS` in some SQL dialects) command is used to return rows from the first query that are not present in the second query. It essentially performs a set difference operation. Both queries must have the same structure (same number and type of columns).

**Usage Example**:
```sql
SELECT user_id
FROM users
EXCEPT
SELECT user_id
FROM cancelled_users;
```
This retrieves users who are present in the `users` table but not in the `cancelled_users` table.

#### **4⃣ SQL Question 4: Filter Netflix Users Based on Viewing History and Subscription Status**

**Question**: You are given a database of Netflix’s user viewing history and their current subscription status. Write a SQL query to find all active customers who watched more than 10 episodes of a show called “Stranger Things” in the last 30 days.

**Tables**:
- **users** table: `user_id` (integer), `active` (boolean)
- **viewing_history** table: `user_id` (integer), `show_id` (integer), `episode_id` (integer), `watch_date` (date)
- **shows** table: `show_id` (integer), `show_name` (text)

**Answer**:
```sql
SELECT
    vh.user_id
FROM
    viewing_history vh
JOIN
    shows s ON vh.show_id = s.show_id
JOIN
    users u ON vh.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE
    s.show_name = 'Stranger Things'
    AND vh.watch_date >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL -30 DAY)
    AND u.active = TRUE
GROUP BY
    vh.user_id
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT vh.episode_id) > 10;
```

#### **5⃣ SQL Question 5: What does it mean to denormalize a database?**

**Question**: Explain the concept and implications of denormalizing a database.

**Answer**:
Denormalization is the process of combining tables or reducing the normalization level of a database schema to improve query performance. This often involves introducing redundancy by adding derived or aggregated fields. While denormalization speeds up read operations, it can increase storage requirements and complicate write operations due to redundancy.

**Implications**:
- **Advantages**: Faster query performance, simplified joins.
- **Disadvantages**: Increased storage, potential for data inconsistency.

#### **6⃣ SQL Question 6: Filter and Match Customer’s Viewing Records**

**Question**: As a data analyst at Netflix, you are asked to analyze the customer’s viewing records. You confirmed that Netflix is especially interested in customers who have been continuously watching a particular genre - ‘Documentary’ over the last month. The task is to find the name and email of those customers who have viewed more than five ‘Documentary’ movies within the last month. ‘Documentary’ could be a part of a broader genre category in the genre field (for example, ‘Documentary, History’). Therefore, the matching pattern could occur anywhere within the string.

**Tables**:
- **movies** table: `movie_id` (integer), `title` (text), `genre` (text), `release_year` (integer)
- **customer** table: `user_id` (integer), `name` (text), `email` (text), `last_movie_watched` (integer), `date_watched` (date)

**Answer**:
```sql
SELECT
    c.name,
    c.email
FROM
    customer c
JOIN
    movies m ON c.last_movie_watched = m.movie_id
WHERE
    m.genre LIKE '%Documentary%'
    AND c.date_watched >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL -1 MONTH)
GROUP BY
    c.user_id, c.name, c.email
HAVING
    COUNT(m.movie_id) > 5;
```

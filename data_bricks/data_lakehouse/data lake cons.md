The concept of "update," "merge," and "delete" in a traditional data lake can be nuanced. Here's a breakdown:

**Traditional Data Lakes (e.g., raw data storage on S3/GCS/ADLS):**

* **Limited Support for Updates/Deletes:** 
    * Typically, data lakes are designed for **appending new data**. 
    * Updates and deletes are generally **not directly supported** at the base level.
    * You often work with **append-only** strategies, where new data is added to the end of the existing data.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Data Versioning:** To handle changes, you might implement data versioning by:
    * Creating new files/partitions for each update or batch.
    * Using a separate "metadata" table to track changes and their timestamps.
* **Data Transformation:** Transformations (like Spark jobs) can be used to:
    * **"Update"**: Apply transformations to create new versions of data with updated values.
    * **"Delete"**: Filter out data that should no longer be included.

**Delta Lake and Other Lakehouse Technologies:**

* **Enhanced Support:** Technologies like Delta Lake, Iceberg, and Hudi are built on top of data lakes and provide features like:
    * **Transactional Updates:** Support for updates, deletes, and merges directly within the data lake layer.
    * **ACID Properties:** Ensure data consistency and reliability with features like atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
    * **Time Travel:** Enable easy data versioning and rollback capabilities.

**In Summary:**

* **Traditional data lakes** primarily focus on appending new data. Updates and deletes can be implemented through data versioning and transformations.
* **Lakehouse technologies** like Delta Lake offer more advanced features, including direct support for updates, deletes, and merges, making them suitable for more complex data management scenarios.

**Key Takeaway:** The level of support for updates, merges, and deletes in a data lake depends on the underlying technology and your implementation approach.

I hope this explanation clarifies the concept of updates, merges, and deletes in the context of data lakes.

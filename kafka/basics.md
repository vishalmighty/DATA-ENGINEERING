# Kafka
## What is kafka
This is a messaging queue

### Usage
Transfer data from one application/micro-service to another

### How it works
Messages are queued non-synchronously between the messaging system and client applications


### Two types of messaging patterns
1. Point to Point -  More than one consumer can consume but one particular message can be consumed by only one consumer
2. Publish Subscribe(Pub-Sub) - More the one consumer can consume the same message
